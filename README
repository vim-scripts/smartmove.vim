1. Jump to next tag on screen in a help file.

When the cursor is at or after the last tag on the screen continue the search
at the top of the screen.

mapped to: <tab>, <s-tab> in normal mode
disable with: let g:loaded_smartmove_nexthelptag=-1

The mapping is created on BufEnter when buftype=help or the buffer is readonly
and filetype=help.

2. Use H and L instead of ctrl-f and ctrl-b

When the cursor is at the top of the screen and H is pressed the screen is
scrolled up. When count is given or the cursor is not at the top of the screen,
the default function of H is executed (Home). Similar for L.

mapped to: H, L in normal and visual mode
disable with: let g:loaded_smartmove_smartscreen=-1
